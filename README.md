This project is based on the current trend of online food ordering, focusing on real-world, practical, and extensive business scenarios. Developed using popular frameworks such as Spring Boot and MyBatis Plus, the project provides hands-on experience in the complete software development process, from requirement analysis to code implementation. By completing this project, I honed my skills in requirement analysis, coding, bug debugging, and gained valuable development experience in a real-world context.
